Challenge# 6 Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard


# Weather-Dashboard-Challenge



- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 6 Challenge.


- The purpose of this challenge was to build a Weather Dashboard that retrieves data form another application's API, using our knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.The goal of this site is to create a weather dashboard that will present the user with todays current weather data and then a future five day forecast.

-  It will also store the past search results allowing the user to select them and see that cities weather data again. As you search the city will be saved to a list allowing you to select them again for viewing.   

- Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

 - Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My task is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

 ## Prerequisites

Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast Links to an external site.to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

### HINT
You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys Links to an external site..

## User Story

```md

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```


  ## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
